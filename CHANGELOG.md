## 0.1.3-pre

Bumped version for dev.

## 0.1.2

Added custom field support - this plugin now supports custom fields in
addresses, subnets, and VLANs, as long as those fields are optional. Data source
searching supports addresses and subnets only, due to limitations in VLAN
searching capabilities.

## 0.1.1

Bumping release so that I have a consistent snapshot, and also so that I can
correct some tests on the compat branch.

## 0.1.0

First release!
